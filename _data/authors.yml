    Hello! I'm Jay, a fourth-year at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm studying Statistics 
    and Political Economy, with a minor in Public Policy. My wheelhouse is defense and security policy, 
    quantitative modeling, and international relations in the Indo-Pacific. 

    In a more chill way, I'm big on experimental recipes, traveling to new places, and urban exploring (which 
    is just my preferred way of talking about getting lost in a big city :). 
    
    I also spent most of my time at Cal as a writer, performer, producer, dramaturg, and one-time board member 
    for BareStage Productions——Berkeley's oldest and largest student-run theatre company. You can check out 
    what I've worked on in my artistic portfolio!
