# About

<p> Hi! I’m Jay, a soon-to-be-grad at the University of California, Berkeley. I’m studying Statistics 
and Political Economy, with a minor in Public Policy. My wheelhouse is defense and security policy, 
quantitative modeling, and international relations in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

<p> But that doesn't really tell the whole story. My jack-of-all trades approach to life has 
  led me through some pretty cool adventures, and I'm excited to share those here! </p>
  
<p> I spent about three years as an Air Force ROTC cadet, I interned at a national lab, and I picked up a good 
    few flight hours along the way. I've also spent time writing, performing, producing and directing for the stage, 
    running exposé financial audits, and testing out experimental recipes on my (mostly willing) friends. </p>

<p> With all the time I have left over, you can find me urban exploring (read: getting horribly lost in any brand new city) 
  or hunting down new books for my baby sister.</p>

<p> Welcome to my page! It's lovely to meet you. </p>
